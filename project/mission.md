## Current Idea

We are evolving the Anamnesis framework into a "Zero-Friction" AI-assisted engineering system. This involves creating an intelligent setup wizard (`INITIATOR.md`), a robust retrofit engine ("The Archaeologist") for existing codebases, and a sustainable update mechanism ("The Weaver") using Shadow Files to separate core framework logic from project-specific customizations.

## Evolution

- [2025-12]: Pivoted to "Zero-Friction" model. Introduced INITIATOR.md, The Archaeologist (Retrofit), and The Weaver (Smart Updates/Shadow Files).

## Success Looks Like

- [ ] Users can initialize a project with a single file copy and a conversation.
- [ ] Existing codebases can be retrofitted with Anamnesis specs that are cited and verified against source code.
- [ ] Framework updates can be applied without overwriting user customizations in directives.
- [ ] 90%+ confidence in automated project detection and retrofit accuracy.

## Constraints

- **Meta-project separation:** Changes to the framework must be made in `anamnesis_starter/`.
- **Shadow File Pattern:** Core logic must be separated from custom logic.
- **Handshake Rule:** AI must propose and wait for approval before implementation.
- **Source Attribution:** Retrofit specs must cite source files.

## Current Phase

Phase 1: The Initiator & Core Refactor Planning.
