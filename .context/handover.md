# Handover: v4.2 Defense-in-Depth Complete

## Where We Are
- **Version:** 4.2 (Defense-in-Depth)
- **Status:** All rules restored, documentation aligned, changes pushed.

## What Was Accomplished This Session
1. **Restored Lost Rules:** Re-applied Golden Rule #6 (Approval Gate) to `anamnesis_starter/AGENTS.md`.
2. **Implemented Handshake Rule:** Added explicit ban on same-turn transitions to kill "Momentum Bias".
3. **Implemented Defense-in-Depth:** Added mandatory stops in `directives/THINKING.md` and `directives/EXECUTION.md`.
4. **Aligned Documentation:** Updated `README.md` with Golden Rule #5 and Pro-Tips about the Consensus Gate.
5. **Updated Learnings:** Documented the "Handshake Rule" and "Defense-in-Depth" success in `PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md`.

## Next Steps
1. **Test v4.2 on real project:** The starter kit is now fully hardened.
2. **Tag Release:** v4.2 is ready.
3. **Monitor Efficacy:** Watch if models still try to skip the handshake.
