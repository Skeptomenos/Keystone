# Handover: v4.1.0 Release Complete

## Where We Are
- **Version:** 4.1.0 released and pushed to main
- **Major additions:** Elimination Test, Phase T-RFL (Reflective Epilogue), directive compression
- **All documentation updated:** CHANGELOG, DECISION_LOG, PROJECT_LEARNINGS, README diagram

## What Was Accomplished This Session
1. Analyzed Musk's 5-Step Algorithm and Gleeson's 15 Questions → integrated Elimination Test
2. Compressed directive files (AGENTS.template.md -44%, EXECUTION_DIRECTIVES -14%)
3. Consolidated Operational Mandates into CODING_STANDARDS Section 9
4. Added Phase T-RFL for reflective Epilogue synthesis
5. Updated README Mermaid diagram for Thinking/Execution/Epilogue flow
6. Added 2 ADRs and 2 new patterns to PROJECT_LEARNINGS

## Next Steps
1. **Test v4.1 on real project** — Validate Elimination Test and T-RFL in practice
2. **Monitor Epilogue compliance** — Does mandatory enforcement reduce "Execute Epilogue" prompts?
3. **Consider v4.2 candidates:**
   - Pre-mortem phase (T1-PM) for new designs?
   - Further compression if needed?
