# Handover: v4.1 Compression & Consolidation

## Where We Are
- **Version:** 4.1.0 released and pushed
- **Key Changes:**
  - AGENTS.template.md: 112 → 63 lines (44% reduction)
  - EXECUTION_DIRECTIVES.md: 288 → 247 lines (14% reduction)
  - THINKING_DIRECTIVES.md: 256 → 248 lines (includes Elimination Test from earlier)
  - CODING_STANDARDS.md: New Section 9 consolidates all 4 Operational Mandates
- **Also Added (earlier in session):** Elimination Test in T1.3 (Musk-inspired deletion-before-optimization)

## What Was Accomplished
- Analyzed Musk's 5-Step Algorithm and Gleeson's 15 Questions for integration potential
- Added Elimination Test (3 prompts) and "clean slate" question to THINKING_DIRECTIVES
- Compressed directive files following telegraphic principles
- Moved Operational Mandates from EXECUTION_DIRECTIVES to CODING_STANDARDS Section 9
- Full epilogue: CHANGELOG, DECISION_LOG, PROJECT_LEARNINGS updated

## Next Steps
1. **Test the framework** on a real project to validate compression doesn't break compliance
2. **Monitor Escape Hatch usage** — now prominent callout box, verify agents respect it
3. **Consider README update** for CLI Configuration (removed from AGENTS.template.md)
4. **Version 4.2 candidates:** Further compression of THINKING_DIRECTIVES if needed

## Git Status
- All changes committed and pushed to main
- Latest commit: `feat(v4.1): compress directive files and consolidate operational mandates`
