# Project Objective: Keystone Framework

> **Purpose:** To solve the core problems of AI-assisted coding (Amnesia, Hallucination, Vibe Coding, Monoliths) through a stateful, spec-driven framework.

---

## Current Focus

**Phase:** v4.3 Task Management & Documentation

The framework now has:
- [x] Separation of Meta-Project and Distributable Starter
- [x] Defense-in-Depth approval gates (v4.2)
- [x] Task management with dependencies (v4.3)
- [x] Workstream support for parallel contexts
- [x] Meta-project dogfooding v4.3

## Success Looks Like

- [x] **Separation:** `keystone_starter/` is a standalone, copy-pasteable directory.
- [x] **Cleanup:** Old `coding/` and `docs/product/` directories are removed.
- [x] **v4.2 Defense:** Handshake Rule and Defense-in-Depth implemented.
- [x] **v4.3 Tasks:** Task management with 6-status workflow, dependencies, workstreams.
- [x] **Dogfooding:** This repository uses the v4.3 structure itself.
- [ ] **Documentation:** Improve README clarity and add visual diagrams.

## Constraints

- **Meta-Project:** Changes here propagate to the definition of the framework.
- **Backwards Compatibility:** Migration guide exists for v4.2 → v4.3.
