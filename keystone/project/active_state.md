## Iteration Log

### 2025-12-21: Transition to Smart Merging
- **Tried:** Removed Shadow File architecture (`.core`/`.custom`) and implemented "Smart Merging" logic in `INITIATOR.md`.
- **Result:** Cleaner directory structure with single directive files. The AI is now responsible for merging framework updates with user customizations.
- **Learning:** While Shadow Files are safer, Smart Merging provides a better user experience by reducing file clutter. The instructions must remain extremely rigorous to prevent logic loss.
