## Iteration Log

### 2025-12-21: Surgical Scan Protocol Implementation
- **Tried:** Implemented the "Surgical Scan Protocol" in `INITIATOR.md` to replace the vague "Scan the codebase" instruction.
- **Result:** The AI now has a structured 3-pass algorithm (Surface, DNA, Deep Dive) for retrofitting existing projects.
- **Learning:** Providing a specific search pattern significantly reduces latency and hallucination risk during the discovery phase.
