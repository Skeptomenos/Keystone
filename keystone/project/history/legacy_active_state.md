## Iteration Log

### 2025-12-21: Automated Rigid Auditor Implementation
- **Tried:** Created `keystone/bin/audit.sh` to automate path integrity, template sync, and protocol consistency checks.
- **Result:** Audit identified missing state files in the starter. Fixed by creating placeholder files.
- **Learning:** Automation is essential for meta-projects. The auditor caught a "Day 1" failure where the AI was instructed to read non-existent files.
