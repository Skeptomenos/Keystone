## Audit History

### 2025-12-21 Audit: Explicit Source/Destination Mapping
- **Status:** PASS
- **Integrity:** Verified all paths in `keystone_starter/AGENTS.md` exist.
- **Consistency:** Cross-reference verified. `INITIATOR.md` now explicitly defines **Source (Remote)** vs **Destination (Local)** to prevent multi-repo confusion.
- **Density:** +2% (Added mapping rules).
- **Notes:** Fixed stale `.core.md` references in update logic.
