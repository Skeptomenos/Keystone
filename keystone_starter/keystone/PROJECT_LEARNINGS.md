### 4.4.1. Smart Merging for Sustainable Updates
- **Learning:** Surgical merging of framework updates into local files provides a cleaner user experience than file-splitting while still preserving project-specific wisdom.
- **Mandate:** Use the Smart Merging Protocol in `INITIATOR.md` to integrate core logic with user rules.
- **Outcome:** Reduced directory clutter and seamless framework evolution.

### 4.4.2. Conversational Onboarding (The Wizard)
- **Learning:** A single-file entry point with conversational logic is more effective than static documentation for complex framework setup.
- **Mandate:** Use `INITIATOR.md` as the primary delivery mechanism for framework features.
- **Outcome:** Reduced onboarding time from minutes to seconds.
