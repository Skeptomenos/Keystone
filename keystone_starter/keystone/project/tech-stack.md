## Adding New Dependencies

Before adding a new dependency, verify:

1. **Is it maintained?** — Last commit < 6 months ago
2. **Is it widely used?** — Reasonable GitHub stars/downloads
3. **Is it necessary?** — Can we achieve this with existing tools?
4. **Size impact?** — Consider bundle size for client-side code

When adding, document:
- What it's for
- Why this one over alternatives
- Date added
